      <p >Linux looks and feels are similar to that of any other UNIX system; certainly, UNIX compatibility has been a chief design goal for the Linux project. However, Linux is much younger compared to most UNIX systems. Its development began in the year 1991, when a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds, wrote and launched Linux, a small but self-contained kernel for 80386 processor. Early at the time of its development, the Linux source code was made free on the Internet so that everyone can compose their distro/version. From an initial kernel which partially employs a small subset of the UNIX system services, the Linux system gradually developed to include much of the ifFNIX functionality.</p>
